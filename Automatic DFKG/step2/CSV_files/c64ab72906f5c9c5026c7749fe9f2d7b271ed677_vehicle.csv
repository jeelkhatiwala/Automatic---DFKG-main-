More information about the 2016 Toyota Avalon Hybrid: With the current Avalon, Toyota worked to modernize its personality, remaking it from a model that was comfort-oriented and conservative to one that feels like other modern luxury sedans, with a more sophisticated, well-detailed look and feel. These updates included much-improved handling, some noteworthy in-cabin technology and a fuel-efficient Avalon Hybrid model. The resulting Avalon is a standout, and when compared against comfort-oriented mainstream large sedans or even against luxury-brand models, the Avalon has a competitive look, feel and feature set. Plus, the Avalon Hybrid&#39;s smooth hybrid powertrain and its 40-mpg city rating make it a package that&#39;s hard to beat. Interesting features of this model are stunning touchscreen-style dash controls, Smooth powertrains, active-safety features, quiet, spacious interior, 40-mpg hybrid model, and excellent ride and handling<br /><br />",GU053785,25,https://carfax-img.vast.com/carfax/-5804084063385201645/,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,20,0.0,ENHANCED,NEW,0,,"Accessories & color may vary.
